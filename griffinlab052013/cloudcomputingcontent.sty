    \begin{itemize}

      \item CloudBioLinux is an open-source
      framework for creating fully automated installation mechanisms for
      bioinformatics software and data.

      \item We have contributed numerous extensions and enhancements to
      CloudBioLinux to make a great environment for building mass spec data analysis
      platforms.

      \item With emerging proteomics applications such as
      proteogenomics, it is becoming essential to build applications
      platforms that tie together traditional proteomic analyses
      with other bioinformatic analyses (such as sequence similarity 
      analysis or genomic mapping). CloudBioLinux is an ideal platform 
      for creating such platforms.

      \item The core CloudBioLinux framework is developed and maintained by
      Brad Chapman, more information can be found at
      http://cloudbiolinux.org/.
