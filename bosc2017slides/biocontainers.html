# ~~A Ubiquitous Approach to Reproducible Bioinformatics Across Computational Platforms~~

# That reproducibility stack Björn discussed (Bioconda and BioContainers) is ideal for computational platforms!

The Slides @ http://bit.ly/bosc-biocontainers

The Twitters `@jmchilton`, `#usegalaxy`, `#commonwl`

???

Welcome, I'm not even going to read the obnoxious title, the real title should just be "That reproducibility stack Björn discussed (Bioconda and BioContainers) is ideal for computational platforms!"

---

## .image-25[![](images/conda_logo.png)] <br /> Conda Key Features for Platforms!

.enlarge120[

- HPC-ready (no root privileges needed)
- Cross-Platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
- Easy to manage and maintain (not just install) *multiple versions* of the same recipe

]

???

If I had a full talk - I'd argue but instead I just need to state without evidence that
Conda is the only package manager discussed today that simulatenously meets all three of
these very important criteria for Galaxy (and I suspect other platforms).

<BREAK>

I love the dedication of Debina Med packagers - their dedicaton somehow makes the
entire open source informatics software ecosystem better. But Galaxy and cwltool
need to run CentOS.

GUIX is stunningly beautiful and the tooling is simply incredible - I think it
does some things in terms of reproducibility better than nix by far. But Galaxy
needs to run on Mac OS X.

I love Homebrew, I love and maintain package definitions, and I use it daily.
I fought hard to make Homebrew appropriate for Galaxy - but one needs to be able
to maintain older versions of packages - not just hack in the ability to install
them - and its just not there. It also lacks the tooling for environment creation
that GUIX and Conda have.

I was very reluctant to come to Conda as the answer, but now I'm willing to
give it an unconditional endorsement for use within computation platforms. The
other potential answers don't check the boxes.

Also Brad uses it!

---

## .image-25[![](images/conda_logo.png)] <br /> SnakeMake

http://bit.ly/snakemake-packages

```sh
snakemake --use-conda
```

```yaml
rule NAME:
    input:
        "table.txt"
    output:
        "plots/myplot.pdf"
    conda:
        "envs/ggplot.yaml"
    script:
        "scripts/plot-stuff.R"
```

```yaml
channels:
 - r
dependencies:
 - r=3.3.1
 - r-ggplot2=2.1.0
```

???

Even if you don't use BioContainers - the Conda base is pretty good for computational
platforms. SnakeMake is a great example of platform that leverages just Conda this way.

---

## Containers in Galaxy and CWL

Galaxy:

```xml
<requirements>
    <container type="docker">dukegcb/seqtk</container>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>    
</requirements>
```

Common Workflow Language:

```yaml
hints:
  DockerRequirement:
    dockerPull: dukegcb/seqtk
  SoftwareRequirement:
    packages:
    - package: seqtk
      version:
      - r93
```

???

But getting into the nitty gritty of containers though - one thing that is clear is Docker
is no longer news. All the big platforms and workflow engines frequently discussed at BOSC 
allow annotation of Docker images for their tools or modules.

Here is syntax for doing this in Galaxy and CWL.

Notice the images are explicit!

---

class: left

## The Problem with Making Docker Explicit

.enlarge120[

An arbitrary container image is a blackbox and there is *no guarantee Galaxy/cwltool/Toil will execute the same binaries* outside the container.

]

???

In Galaxy, we've not really advertised our Docker support in tools aggressively because we 
aren't happy about explicit annotation this way. We already annotate tools with packages that are installable non-containerized enviornments. This is very important for HPC.

So in our view the explicit annotation of containers is both un-nessecary work the tool 
developer (thanks to BioContainers) and hurts reproducibility - since that image is a blackbox and
may not provide the same binaries and libraries as the package 
annotations.

---

## BioContainers - Bioconda for Containers

.pull-right[.image-75[.center[![](images/biocontainers.png)]]]

*All* Bioconda packages are built into minimal containers.

This setup allows the *same binaries to be used within the container or on traditional (HPC) resources*.

Without any extra work by tool authors, **Galaxy can automatically find or build “the
correct” container** for a best-practice tool.

???

So our preferred approach to containers is now ready to go thanks to BioContainers.
Björn already discussed these in depth - I will just say that Biocontainers have enabled 
Galaxy to find or build containers on-demand for all best-practice Galaxy tools.

---

## A Launching Point for Galaxy

By shifting the burden of handling details of containers from the tool author to
the platform, we have increased reproducibility and made available containers for all
"best practice" tools.

We can do some cool new things with these containers:
- Singularity support for Galaxy.
- Native container scheduling Kubernetes and Mesos (via Chronos) support.
- Library support.

See [bit.ly/gcc-biocontainers](https://bit.ly/gcc-biocontainers) for more details.

???

By shifting the burden of handling details of containers from the tool author to
the platform, we have increased reproducibility and made available containers for all
"best practice" tools without any extra effort from the tool author.

Having containers for thousands of tools now is enabling us to do some pretty exciting
things in Galaxy. Check out my GCC talk from a month ago to dig deeper into these - but
some highlights include supporting Singularity for Galaxy tools as well as enabling
native container scheduling in both Kubernetes and Mesos. 

A lot of these Galaxy goodies aren't tied to our platform or our tool format and are
avaiable in galaxy-lib, a small subset of Galaxy that allows reuse of bits and pieces of Galaxy.

---

## Bioconda and BioContainers for CWL

.border[.center[![](images/cwl_pr_merged.png)]]

The same reproducibility stack using the same libraries has been integrated into cwltool and an open PR exists for Toil (Conda + BioContainers).

???

One cool thing we have done with galaxy-lib is used it to bring this reproducibility
stack to CWL.

cwltool now supports both Conda dependency resolution of CWL SoftwareRequirements that is ideal for HPC settings - as well as supporting the find or build BioContainers strategy for using these same dependencies inside of containers.

An open PR exists for adding similar support to toil as well.

---

## CWL Tools Almost as Cool as Galaxy

The Tool

```yaml
hints:
  SoftwareRequirement:
    packages:
    - package: seqtk
      version:
      - r93
```

Running with cwltool

```sh
$ pip install 'cwltool[deps]'
$ cwltool --beta-conda-dependencies tests/seqtk_seq.cwl tests/seqtk_seq_job.json
$ cwltool --beta-use-biocontainers tests/seqtk_seq.cwl tests/seqtk_seq_job.json
```

Running with Toil (fork)

```sh
$ pip install 'git+https://github.com/jmchilton/toil@cwldeps#egg=toil[cwl]'
$ cwltoil --beta-conda-dependencies tests/seqtk_seq.cwl tests/seqtk_seq_job.json
$ cwltoil --beta-use-biocontainers tests/seqtk_seq.cwl tests/seqtk_seq_job.json
```

???

I won't go into detail about how to use - I'll just note there are now simple flags to enable both of these modes of operation - and mention they documented well in cwltool's README.

---

## CWL Support - An Application from James Taylor

.border[.center[.image-75[![](images/vision.png)]]]

- https://github.com/bxlab/vision-workflows
- ChIP-seq workflow (following ENCODE best practices) - combines 11 tools.
- Worked with Docker but needed to run on local HPC resources.
- Conflicting dependencies prevent global installation of dependencies.
- With per-tool Conda environments and cwltool this just worked!

???

Here is an application from my first real user of this CWL work.
James Taylor built these ChIP-seq worklfows based on ENCODE best practices
and everything worked well in Docker-based testing. But ultimately he needed
these to run in an HPC environment. He tried building a big global environment
with all the dependencies but they were conflicting. Switching his CWL execution
to per-tool Conda environments (the way Galaxy would have done it) enabled everything
to just work.

---

## Quick Aside: It isn't just Conda

.enlarge120[

Galaxy's entire dependency resolution plugin system is available - meaning support
for **Enviornment Modules, Homebrew (beta), etc.** are available in cwltool as well.

You don't have to use the Bioconda/BioContainers stack to use the plugin infrastructure to
really **enable CWL on HPC**!

]

---

## Key Points

.enlarge120[

- Conda is uniquely qualified to manage packages for scientific computational platforms -
  it represents the best practice approach within Galaxy & SnakeMake.
- BioConda + Biocontainers now provide reproducibility both inside and outside of containers.
- Galaxy, cwltool, and Toil* can now use this stack to provide reproduciblity across packages and Docker.
- Galaxy extends this reproduciblity by providing support for Singularity, persistent
  provenance tracking, and usable UIs for everything from job management and workflow building to data sharing.

## Generic Containers are Good Slide

.center[.image-75[![](images/container_vs_vm.svg)]]

* Isolation and Security\*
* Reproducibility
* Flexibility\*

.center[.footnote[\* the industry is getting there]]

???

I'm not going to belabor the point made frequently - containers are light
weight alternatives to more traditional virtualization technology. The have
real possiblity of providing more secure, reproducible, and flexible ways
to execute tools in Galaxy.

---

## Galaxy in Containers?

.center[
.image-75[![](images/docker-galaxy-stable-github.png)]
]

???

When people think Galaxy and containers I think this project comes to mind.
Three years ago Björn created this docker-galaxy-stable project and it has
been wildly successful. It has proven to be a useful toolkit for advanced
deployment options, an extremely portable way to bring Galaxy to new domains,
and a brilliant tool for training users.

https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/commit/27ef7966508958dfec9ce35ff1c5f076ffccf80f

Also mention Galaxy KickStart as a way to run Galaxy itself in a container.

---

## Containerizing Galaxy vs Tools

.enlarge120[
We are going to discuss *containerizing jobs* instead of all of Galaxy.

Small containers for a job's tool.

However you deploy Galaxy, including in a container, tool execution can still be containerized.
]

???

So we are talking about running Galaxy's jobs in containers, not Galaxy itself. We will be discussing
matching minimal best practice containers for particular tools.

Small, best-practice containers for a job's tool.

Even if you deploy Galaxy via a container, you can still containerize its jobs - so this approach is
complimentary to docker-galaxy-stable not competing.s

## Configuring Galaxy to Use Containers

Just configure the destination. For instance, transform the cluster destination:

```xml
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
</destination>
```

as follows:


```xml
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
    <param id="docker_enabled">true</parma>
    <param id="docker_sudo">false</param>
</destination>
```

## Explicit Container Dependencies

```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

into

```xml
<requirements>
    <container type="docker">dukegcb/seqtk</container>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

## Containerizing Tool Execution

* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy where to find a container for the tool.
* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

We're done... right?

---

## To Put it Another Way

.enlarge120[

This:

```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

should have been sufficient!

]

???

We shouldn't have had to modify the tool to get the containers working, and
indeed specifying containers separately from requirements introduced a strong
possibility of environment drift between package and container execution.

---

## Another Problem...

.enlarge120[

```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

In 2014, this wasn't even sufficient for normal, containerless execution.

The resolution of these requirements required a `tool_dependencies.xml` file and required the tool to be published to a tool shed before it could be resolved.

]

???

How can I build a container for that requirements set if that requirements set
is useless until the tool has been published to the tool shed.

---

![](images/conda_logo.png)

Package, dependency and environment management

???

We needed a new package manager to be able to build and publish containers for a set of requirements.

This work started at last years GCC hackathon by Brad and Marius and was improved and refined
by Martin.

---

## Managing Tool Dependencies

.center[![](images/dependency_manage.png)]

???

Marius followed up and added detailed admin controls for managing sets of dependencies. With
the older Tool Shed dependency management - sets of dependencies were dependent on the tool and
install context - so GUIs like this wouldn't have worked well.

---

## Planemo

Conda is enabled by default in Planemo and the documentation has been overhauled with detailed
Conda information.

# Conda has been a revolution for tool development and deployment.

---

## Back to Requirements...

.enlarge120[

```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

We can now install and resolve dependencies using this alone!

Therefore, we can *find and build containers using just this also*.

]

---

## Bioconda

.border[.center[![](images/bioconda_github.png)]]

For comparison to similar projects - Homebrew-science has had 261 commits from 34 authors during the same period. DebianMed has had no new activity in 2017.

## BioContainers - Bioconda for Containers

.pull-right[.center[![](images/biocontainers.png)]]

**All** Bioconda packages are built into minimal containers.

This setup allows the **same binaries to be used within the container or on traditional/HPC resources**.
Without any extra work by tool authors, Galaxy can automatically find or build “the correct” container for a best-practice tool.

Over 2,300 containers already available.

## ~~The Problems with Making Docker Explicit~~

.enlarge120[

* ~~Setting up a `Dockerfile` and publishing a Docker image more process for the tool even though the *dependencies have already been completely defined*.~~
* ~~An arbitrary Docker image is a blackbox and there is *no guarantee Galaxy will execute the same binaries* as the Conda requirements.~~

Galaxy can now just find or build BioContainers from `requirement` tags in best practice tools.

]

---

## BioContainers - For Administrators

- In `galaxy.ini`, set `enable_beta_mulled_containers = True`
- In `job_conf.xml`, configure destination

```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="docker_enabled">true</parma>
    <param id="docker_sudo">false</param>
</destination>
```

???

Should work with all traditional cluster job runners, the local job runner, Pulsar, etc...

From Singularity's about page:

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> ***Singularity blocks privilege escalation*** within the container so if you want to be root inside the container, you first must be root outside the container. This usage paradigm mitigates many of the security concerns that exists with containers on multi-tenant shared resources.<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

## Using Singularity (requires Galaxy 17.09)

- In `galaxy.ini`, set `enable_beta_mulled_containers = True`
- In `job_conf.xml`, configure destination

```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">

---

## We didn't forget about HPC - we made packages more robust for HPC clusters as we also integrated HPC friendly containerization techonology.

---

## Common Workflow Language Support

.border[.center[![](images/cwl_pr.png)]]

The same reproducibility stack using the same libraries can be integrated into CWL (Conda + BioContainers).

---

## Scheduling - From Clusters to Containers

**Cluster Jobs**

- Submit a script to execution infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure is DRM (e.g. SLURM) schedules job script.
- Run directly on cluster node (bare metal or VM).

**Containerized Cluster Jobs (Before 2017)**

- Submit a script to execution infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure is DRM (e.g. SLURM) schedules job script.
- *Script runs command via Docker host on cluster node.*

**Native Container Jobs (2017 and Beyond)**

- Submit container ID and command to infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure (e.g. Kubernetes) schedules container execution directly.
- No need to manage clusters or Docker hosts.

---

## Docker Execution Goals

In moving from traditional cluster jobs to containerized cluster jobs the goal is *increased isolation and reproducibility*.

In moving from containerized cluster jobs to native container scheduling technologies is *elimination of cluster management software and delegating job scaling to service providers (e.g. Google and Amazon)*.

---

## Container Scheduling

From Amazon ECS

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>Amazon ECS ***eliminates the need to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure***, and allows you to schedule Docker-enabled applications across your cluster based on your resource needs and availability requirements. Amazon ECS enables you to ***grow from a single container to thousands of containers across hundreds of instances without any additional complexity*** in how you run your application.<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
