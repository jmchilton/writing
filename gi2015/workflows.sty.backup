  \flexblock{Workflows}{

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A salient feature of Galaxy is that it allows researchers to extract analysis histories as examples
      out into reusable workflows. Despite the popularity of this feature, the kinds of workflows that could be
      expressed by Galaxy in the past have had critical limitations. Perhaps chief among these are that the workflow
      engine planned out every job right at submission time (leaving little room for dynamic computation) and
      Galaxy workflows have required a static number of inputs. Many common and relatively simple analyses in
      bioinformatics require running a variable number of inputs across identical processing steps (``mapping'')
      and then combining or collecting these results into a merged output (``reducing''). Likewise - many requested
      advanced features such as pausing workflows, splitting inputs up into multiple datasets, and conditionals all
      require the re-evaluation of workflows overtime. This work will discuss how we have started addressing
      these limitations.

\def\collectionsblock{
  \flexblock{Dataset Collections}{
      Galaxy dataset collections allow gathering datasets into potentially nested hierarchies of lists and pairs and
      operating on them as units. Pre-existing Galaxy tools can be used without modification to ``map'' operations across
      dataset collections to produce new collections. Likewise tools that consume many datasets can be readily used to
      ``reduce`` these collections. For newly developed tools - a wide range of extensions to Galaxy tooling format exist
      to consume and produce dataset collections. In addition to presenting these additions to Galaxy, extensions to the
      workflow system to tie together these analyses and innovative UI elements such as the paired list dataset collection
      builder will be presented.

\def\cwl{

  \flexblock{Common Workflow Language}{

Engineers from leading bioinformatics platform
teams (Curoverse, Galaxy Team, and Seven Bridges Genomics) and a tool author (Michael R. Crusoe /
khmer project) started working together at the BOSC 2014 Codefest with an initial focus on developing
a portable means of representing, sharing and invoking command line tools which was then the basis for
portable workflow descriptions. The group placed high value on re-using existing formats and ontologies.

On March 31st, 2015 the group released their second draft of the Common Workflow Language specification.
The serialized form is a YAML document that is validated by an Apache Avro schema and can be interpreted
as an RDF graph using JSON-LD. The documents are also valid Wf4Ever ''wfdesc`` descriptions after a simple
transformation. Future drafts will include the use of the EDAM ontology to describe the tools enabling
discovery via the ELIXIR tool registry.
