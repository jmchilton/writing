# Bioconda and BioContainers
## Enabling Universal Reproducibility in Galaxy

## Galaxy in Containers?

.image-75[![](images/docker-galaxy-stable-github.png)]

???

When people think Galaxy and containers I think this project comes to mind.
Three years ago Björn created this docker-galaxy-stable project and it has
been wildly successful. It has proven to be a useful toolkit for advanced
deployment options, an extremely portable way to bring Galaxy to new domains,
and a brilliant tool for training users.

## Containerizing Galaxy vs Tools

???

TODO: Discuss difference - mention docker-galaxy-stable and galaxy-kickstarter

---

class: left

### Containerizing Tools is Important Also

* Isolated tool execution.
* Isolate file system access.
* Added layer of security.
* Increased re-computability.
* New deployment options - Kubernetes, Mesos Chronos, AWS Batch, etc.

### Containerizing Tool Execution

Decomposes to basic problems:

* <i class="fa fa-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy where to find a container for the tool.
* <i class="fa fa-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

### Three Years Ago...

Opened this PR within a few months of Björn.

### Configuring Galaxy to Use Containers

Just configure the destination. For instance, transform the cluster destination:

```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
</destination>
```

as follows:


```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
    <param id="docker_enabled">true</parma>
    <param id="docker_sudo">false</param>
</destination>
```

## Explicit Container Dependencies

```
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

into

```
<requirements>
    <container type="docker">dukegcb/seqtk</container>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

### Containerizing Tool Execution

#### Decomposes to basic problems

* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy where to find a container for the tool.
* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

We're done... right?

## The Problems with Making Docker Explicit

* Setting up a `Dockerfile` and publishing a Docker image more process for the tool even though the dependencies have already been completely defined.
* An arbitrary Docker image is a blackbox that we can't be sure will execute the same binaries as the Conda requirements.

---

## Put it Another Way

This:

```
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

should have been sufficient!

---

## Put it Another Way

```
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

In 2014, this wasn't even sufficient for containerless execution. The resolution of these requirements required a `tool_dependencies.xml` file and required the tool to be published to a tool shed before it could be resolved.

???

How can I build a container for that requirements set if that requirements set is useless until the tool has 
been published to the tool shed.

Package, dependency and environment management

---

.image-50[![](images/conda_logo.png)]

- Based on recipes describing how to install the software which are then built for their distribution
- No compilation at installation: binaries with their dependencies, libraries...
- Not restricted to Galaxy

---

###.image-25[![](images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Conda distributions

```


```
![](images/miniconda_vs_anaconda.png)

---

###.image-25[![](images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Channels

- Packages through channels within Continuum.Anaconda
- Conda channel searched by Galaxy for packages:
    - iuc
    - bioconda
    - defaults
    - r
    - conda-forge

---

### BioConda (1 / 2)

![](images/bioconda_github.png)

???

For comparison to similar projects - Homebrew-science has had 261 commits from 34 authors during the same period. DebianMed has had no new activity in 2017.

---

### BioConda (2 / 2)

Compared with the Tool Shed dependency management (`tool_dependencies.xml`), BioConda is:

- More popular!
- Easier to develop.
- Easier to install and test.

???

---

### BioContainers - BioConda for Containers

![](images/biocontainers.png)

All Bioconda packages are built into minimal containers.

This setup allows the same binaries to be used within the container or on traditional/HPC resources.
Without any extra work by tool authors, Galaxy can automatically find or build “the correct” container for a best-practice tool.

Over 2,300 containers already available.

*We are not aware of another platform that supports this level of reproducibility inside and outside of containers.*

### BioContainers - For Administers

Describe setting up Galaxy...

---

### BioContainers - For Developers

Describe Planemo tooling options related to containers.

---

### BioContainers - More Exotic Tools

Describe how multiple requirement containers are handled.

## Scheduling - From Clusters to Containers

Cluster Jobs:

- Submit a script to execution infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure is DRM (e.g. SLURM) schedules job script.
- Run directly on cluster node (bare metal or VM).

Containerized Cluster Jobs (as of GCC 2016):

- Submit a script to execution infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure is DRM (e.g. SLURM) schedules job script.
- *Script runs command via Docker host on cluster node.*

Native Container Jobs (as of GCC 2017)

- Submit container ID and command to infrastructure.
- Execution infrastructure (e.g. Kubernetes) schedules container execution.
- No need to manage clusters or Docker hosts.

## Container Scheduling

From Amazon ECS

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>Amazon ECS ***eliminates the need to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure***, and allows you to schedule Docker-enabled applications across your cluster based on your resource needs and availability requirements. Amazon ECS enables you to ***grow from a single container to thousands of containers across hundreds of instances without any additional complexity*** in how you run your application.<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
